This project is something I followed along with watching a React tutorial on Javascript Mastery's youtube page. Which can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/@javascriptmastery

It helped me understand React a lot better and I'm very happy I took the time to see it through to completion.

It's a personal Web Developer Portfolio with 3d objects that are functional and you can play with them. It's really fun and interactive!

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
